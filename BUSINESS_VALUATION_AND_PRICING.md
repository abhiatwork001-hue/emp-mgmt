# Chickinho Platform: Business Valuation & SaaS Strategy

**Date**: January 2026  
**Status**: Production-Ready, Pre-Launch

---

## 1. 💎 Current Valuation (Two Exit Paths)

### Option A: Asset Sale (Sell the Code)
**Buyer Profile**: Large restaurant group (Portugalia, H3) or ERP competitor wanting white-label

**Valuation Method**: Replacement Cost + IP Premium

**Calculation**:
- Development (9 months, 2 developers): **€90,000**
- Product Management & Design: **€20,000**
- Infrastructure setup: **€5,000**
- **Subtotal (Cost)**: €115,000

**IP Premium** (30-50% for specialized vertical SaaS):
- Smart Order Planner logistics engine: +€15k
- Compliance rules engine: +€10k
- Mobile app (Capacitor): +€10k
- **Subtotal (IP)**: €35,000

**Market Discount** (no revenue yet): -20% = **-€30,000**

### 💰 **Recommended Asset Sale Price: €100,000 - €120,000**

**Payment Structure**:
- €80k upfront
- €20-40k over 12 months (post-launch support)

---

### Option B: SaaS Business (Keep & Operate)
**Buyer Profile**: Angel investors or VC buying equity stake

**Valuation Method**: ARR Multiple (Annual Recurring Revenue)

**Realistic Year 1 Projections** (Lisbon Market):

| Metric | Conservative | Optimistic |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| Month 1-3 (Beta) | 5 stores @ €0 | 10 stores @ €0 |
| Month 4-6 | 15 stores @ €49 | 25 stores @ €69 |
| Month 7-12 | 40 stores @ €69 | 60 stores @ €99 |
| **End Year 1 ARR** | **€33,120** | **€71,280** |

**SaaS Multiples** (European B2B SaaS, 2026):
- Pre-revenue (now): 1-2x projected ARR = **€70k - €140k** (company value)
- €50k ARR: 3-5x = **€150k - €250k**
- €100k ARR: 5-8x = **€500k - €800k**

### 💰 **Current Pre-Revenue Valuation: €100,000 - €150,000**
*(Company value for equity sale, e.g., selling 20% = €20k-€30k)*

**Post-Launch (6 months, €40k ARR)**: **€200k - €320k**  
**12 Months (€70k ARR)**: **€350k - €560k**

## 4. 🇵🇹 Why Portugal is the Perfect Market

### Advantages:
1. **Labor Law Complexity**: ACT (Portuguese labor authority) has strict rules. Your compliance engine is a painkiller, not vitamin.
2. **Franchise Culture**: McDonald's, Burger King, Pizza Hut—Portugal has high chain density.
3. **Digital Literacy**: Managers are tech-savvy (WhatsApp-native generation).
4. **Grant Funding**: Portugal 2030 provides subsidies for SMEs buying software. You can help customers apply.

### Competitive Landscape:
- **Factorial HR**: Generic, no restaurant-specific features (€5/employee/month)
- **Combo**: POS system, doesn't do scheduling well
- **Excel + WhatsApp**: Your real competitor (free but chaotic)

**Your Moat**: You are the ONLY system that does Smart Ordering + Compliance in one tool.

## 6. 🤝 Recommendation: Which Path?

### Sell Now (Asset Sale) If:
- You need liquidity immediately
- You don't want to do sales/marketing
- You have another opportunity

**Exit Value**: €100k-€120k (one-time)

---

### Build the SaaS If:
- You believe in the vision
- You can dedicate 12-18 months
- You have €20k-€50k runway (or can raise)

**Exit Value (2 years)**: €350k-€750k (equity sale or dividend stream)

---

## 7. 🎁 Bonus: Quick Win Strategy

**"The Chickinho Exclusive"**:
1. Offer Chickinho franchise **FREE Forever** (it's your own company)
2. Perfect the product with real daily use
3. Use Chickinho as case study: "10 stores, 200 employees, 0 scheduling errors"
4. Sell to other brands: "If it can handle Chickinho's complexity, it can handle yours"

**This builds PROOF before spending on ads.**

## 📋 Summary

| Model | Value Now | Value (Year 2) | Risk | Effort |
|-------|-----------|----------------|------|--------|
| **Asset Sale** | €100-120k | N/A | Low | Low |
| **SaaS (Bootstrap)** | €100k | €350-560k | Medium | High |
| **SaaS (Funded)** | €150k | €750k+ | Medium | Very High |

**My Recommendation**: Try SaaS for 6 months. If you get to 20 stores (€1,500 MRR), you've validated the market. If not, sell the code (price will be same or higher with proof of usage).

**You've built something valuable. The question is: Do you want €120k today, or €500k in 2 years?**
